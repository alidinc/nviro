# Implementation

There are six view controllers. The first one is the SearchViewController that users can make a search for a city/country from a text field to show air pollution measurements in the second view controller SearchDetailViewController. Users can then save any favourite cities in their list by tapping on a heart icon inside the SearchDetailViewController to navigate them to VenueMapViewController. In this venue view, users can explore vegan & vegetarian venues around the saved location. In the fifth view controller that is CarbonCalculateViewController, users can calculate their carbon offset simply by making a search for an airport from text fields. Then they'll see an animated CarbonResultsViewController. In the last main view controller, users can read the latest news about climate change.
